If someone hasn't heard of [Ghibli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli)
I recommend to at least watch
[Castle in the Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky).

Some of the music written for the Ghibli animations was done by
[Joe Hisaishi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hisaishi). He is a talented
composer, and performer. Listen for example to
[Mononoke Hime](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvgKtOH8l2M).
