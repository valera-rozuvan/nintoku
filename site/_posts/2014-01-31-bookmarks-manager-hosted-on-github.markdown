[bookmarks](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bookmarks) seems like a nice
starting point. Things to do:

- add tags, search by tags
- allow hierarchy of tags (sort of like directories)
- don't display all bookmarks on one page
- allow easy edit with text editor of file with bookmarks
- import and append from Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE
- locally, web GUI for CRUD operations on bookmarks
- allow for using custom themes to display bookmarks
- preview for a link (an image overlay)

Back-end could be [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based. Front-end could be
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based. Preview could be done with
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
([Phantomjs - take screenshot of a web page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17189745/phantomjs-take-screenshot-of-a-web-page)).

Sounds like fun ^_^v!
