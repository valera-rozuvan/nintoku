OK! So first post of new year = ) I want to write about how I participated in "last year's"
[4th Grand Prix half marathon Yule 2015](http://42195.kiev.ua/gran-pri-kievskaya-rus/GrandPrix-half-marathon/reglament-13.html).
It was held on the last Sunday of the 2015 year, in the small town of
[Vyshhorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyshhorod). As with all such events, it was sponsored in part by
[Red Bull](http://www.redbull.com/en).

There were 2 events once could participate in. The half marathon distance of 21.1km, and the double mini distance of
8.4km. I competed in the double mini event, running for the first time in a competition!

The event Yule 2015 was very high spirited! One of it's main themes was to wear new year's holiday costumes.
For example there were several Santa Clauses spotted running = ) Many people wore small attributes. For example,
masks or colored hair wigs.

Overall, I placed 26-th in the 8.4km "double-mini" distance. I am proud of the result, and hope to compete in
other events in the 2016 year!!!
