Even at a time like this, the street is filled with people.

You know what I think, she says, the people's memories might be the fuel they
burn to stay alive.

That often slipped into the surreal.

Do you speak English. Where are you staying? Follow me, and I am going to take
you somewhere where you can get a cab.

Sometimes it comes, and sometimes it stops coming. You need every help you can
get. In dark places there are small things waiting to help you.

It makes you feel differently. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from
Ipanema comes waling. But each day as she walks to the sea she looks straight
ahead not at me. The tune always brings back memories of the corridor of my
high school. The damp concrete floor of my hight school.

It was almost always silent. The girl from Ipanema reminds me of my high school
floor.

The real world.

There was a pianist. A pianist who was so good, that kings came to his
concerts. No one knew him.

Life is what you make it. There is nothing exterior. It is all inside.
