Yoshisaburo Okakura.

> The winter, though it begins its dreary course with a short period of
warm days known as the Little Spring, is of course not without its bleak
mornings with cutting winds and icy wreaths. But the fact that even as
far north as Tôkyô no elaborate system of warming rooms is at all
developed, and that the occasional falling of snow is hailed even by
aged men of letters, and still more by the numerous poetasters, as a fit
occasion for a pedestrian excursion to some neighboring localities for a
better appreciation of the silvery world, serves to show how mild the
cold is in south Japan.

[Yamato-damashii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato-damashii) is term in the
Japanese language meant to refer the spiritual and cultural values and
characteristics of the Japanese people.
