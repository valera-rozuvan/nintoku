2013 is nearing to an end. I have taken the time this morning to reflect on
some global things that have happened this year. It surprised me that all I
could think up was the
[Snowden's case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), and the
[USA government shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013).
I must have been either really busy, or simply didn't pay attention outside of
the world of programming.

Just a side note. Notice that so far I only use
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) for information? Anyways...

Then I decided to research the state of the global economy. I discovered that
the information on the net is plentiful (isn't it always?). To summarize, I
have created a repository on
[world economy](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/world-economy) with
interesting links. I hope to find some time later to delve into this topic
deeper.
