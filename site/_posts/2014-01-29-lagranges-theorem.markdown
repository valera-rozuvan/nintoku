In his 1771 paper
[**Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations**](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k229222d/f206.image),
[Lagrange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange) was studying
polynomials. In particular he was interested in polynomials of degree 5 and
higher. This was the ground work that was user later on by
[Galois](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois) to put forth the
beginning of [Galois theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory).
