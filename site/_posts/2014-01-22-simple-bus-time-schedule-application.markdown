Today at my company we discussed possible small project's we can work on in our
spare time. The idea of creating an application to display the most up-to-date
bus schedule was most appealing. It will have an iPhone, Android, and Web
interface. The plan is to maintain it as an open-source application
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/innovecs-opensource/bustime).
