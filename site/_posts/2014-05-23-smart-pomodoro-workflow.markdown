[Pomodoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique to
allow for greater control on working. The main idea is that

1. You pick a task, write it down.
2. Start your Pomodoro timer.
3. Work only on the task while the Pomodoro timer is ticking. No multitasking!
No switching to something else - even for a minute!
4. When the Pomodoro timer stops, you stop working at the task and mark it
on paper.
5. Take a break.
6. Repeat the whole process from step 1.

Two issues come up with the basic Pomodoro technique.

1. What if you are interrupted during a Pomodoro session?
2. What if you complete the task before the Pomodoro timer goes off?

I believe that both cases can be handled by modifying step 4 of the above list,
so that it includes:

> If you are interrupted, or you complete the task before the Pomodoro timer
stops, then stop the Pomodoro timer manually, and continue to the next step.

This little change makes a big difference to the original Pomodoro technique.
It ensures that you work on a task uninterrupted, that you stay in the zone.
You are required to start-over the whole process if you are interrupted, or
you complete a task early.

The **smart** thing is that a Pomodoro session is for one and one task only.
The **smart** thing is that a Pomodoro session can't be interrupted - it can
only be stopped.

So, the **Smart** Pomodoro process is as follows:

The key thing to note is that this approach enforces you to work on a task
for a set period of time without interruptions and task switching. The Pomodoro
timer can be set to anything you like. Ideally, with the **Smart** Pomodoro
workflow, you will achieve an in-the-zone working experience!
