[Xonix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xonix) is a classical game. There are
several examples ([one](http://www.vemix.com/Games/xonix/xonix.php),
[two](http://html5xonix.appspot.com/)) of it in JavaScript. Almost half a year
ago I have started to make a game that borrows from the ideas of Xonix, and
adds a few twists. You can take a
[look](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/vonix), but the sources are in a very
raw state.

The twists will include:
* Online multi-player
* The world will have a point based geometry, rather than a square based geometry
* Player movement paths will be smooth, not angular
* Gravity
