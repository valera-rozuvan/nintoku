On [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/) I have posed
the following question:

I am currently studying the manuscript **Group Theory: A First Journey** by
Vipul Naik. It is available from the web page
http://www.cmi.ac.in/~vipul/mathjourneys/ . In this manuscript the author
proposes the following question:

> Suppose the ordering of the elements in the rows and columns is the same.
Then what kind of multiplication table would a magma have if it were to be a
group? More generally, what are the constraints on the multiplication table
corresponding to each of the properties that we can talk of for a binary
operation?

After reading
[the comments and the answers](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/666142/an-interesting-question-from-group-theory-a-first-journey)
made by other users, I began to understand what the author is asking. He wants
the reader to think how would a multiplication matrix look like for a magma
that follows the 3 requirements of a group. Maybe not look like, but what
properties, patterns, etc. it would exhibit.
