I am at work. It seems that everything is calm; got to work in
a normal fashion. Today is a reading day.

Starting to work!

I have slept today to heart's content! I should do so more
often. There is an absolute clearness in my head, I am not
yawning, the eyes are wide open. Today I will read English
literature, and should also read some Russian.

To write, one must read, read, read!
