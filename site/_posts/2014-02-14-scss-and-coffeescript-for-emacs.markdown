[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com)

> Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS
extension language in the world.

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)

> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath
that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart.
CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple
way.

Thanks to the following resources:

- [sass-mode](https://github.com/nex3/sass-mode)
- [coffee-mode](https://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode)

I now [have an Emacs](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/emacs_config) that highlights for me `.scss` and `.coffee` files.
