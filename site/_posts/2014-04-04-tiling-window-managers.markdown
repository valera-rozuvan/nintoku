Currently, I am using the [nwm](https://github.com/mixu/nwm) window
manager. A [window manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) is
a:

> system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within
a windowing system in a graphical user interface.

The nwm was written by [Mikito Takada](http://mixu.net) (mixu). The author
describes it as:

> a dynamic window manager for X11 written with Node.js.

This window manager caught my eye because parts of it are written in the
[JavaScript language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). I myself
mostly code JavaScript these days, so the project jumped out at me. After
using this window manager for about a month, I have decided that it is
solid, and it's philosophy of tiling windows is awesome. I have never before
used a [tiling window manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager)!

However, the nwm window manager has some quirks in it. They are not critical.
For example, not all windows from the start are positioned correctly within
an already present tiling setup (Emacs). But most of the quirks can be corrected
by simply issuing a rearrange command.

I have been looking for other tiling window managers, that work well with Gnome
out of the box. Here is the (non-exhaustive) list:

- [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org)
- [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)
- [X-tile](http://www.giuspen.com/x-tile)
- [spectrwm](https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/spectrwm)
- [shellshape](http://gfxmonk.net/shellshape)
- [Bluetile](http://www.bluetile.org)
- [aewm](http://www.red-bean.com/decklin/aewm)
- [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- [wmii](https://wiki.debian.org/Wmii) ([official site](https://code.google.com/p/wmii))

A discussion on this topic, and a list of EWMH compatible window managers:
- [Is there a keyboard-centric desktop/WM available?](http://askubuntu.com/questions/1844/is-there-a-keyboard-centric-desktop-wm-available)
- [Extended Window Manager Hints: Tiling and dynamic window managers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints#Tiling_and_dynamic_window_managers)

Over the next little while I hope to try some of these out!
