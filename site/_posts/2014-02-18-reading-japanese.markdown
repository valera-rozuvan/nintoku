Not literally. Just got my English books by the Japanese author
[Banana Yoshimoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Yoshimoto). I ordered
them a while ago on Amazon.

- [Hardboiled and Hard Luck](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802142621/)
- [The Lake](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1612190898/)

Yay!

Listening to [Arthur Rubinstein - Chopin Mazurkas, Op. 6 - Op. 68](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgM1SkMiqY).
Specifically [Mazurka Op. 17, No. 4](http://goo.gl/rQxQjr)
