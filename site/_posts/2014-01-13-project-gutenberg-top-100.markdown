Project Gutenberg is

> a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to "encourage the
creation and distribution of eBooks".[2] It was founded in 1971 by Michael S.
Hart and is the oldest digital library.

It has a handy list of most downloaded books from today, yesterday, last week,
and last month. There is also such a list for authors.
