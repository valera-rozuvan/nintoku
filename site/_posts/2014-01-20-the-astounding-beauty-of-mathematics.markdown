> Oh, if only mathematics loved me as much as I love her!

Since the time the [Clay Mathematics Institute](http://www.claymath.org/)
announced
[The Millennium Prize Problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems)
in 2000,
one of them have been solved
([Poincaré Conjecture](http://www.claymath.org/millenium-problems/poincar%C3%A9-conjecture)),
and another one
([Navier–Stokes Equation](http://www.claymath.org/millenium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation))
has a promising solution that is undergoing a verification.

1. [A news article](http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2619922) announcing that
KAZINFORM Mukhtarbai Otelbayev, a professor from Astana, has solved one of the
seven most difficult mathematical tasks included in the number of "millennium
problems".

2. [Mukhtarbai Otelbayev's paper](http://www.math.kz/index.php/ru/513)
([PDF](http://www.math.kz/images/journal/2013-4/Otelbaev_N-S_21_12_2013.pdf))
in a Russian journal published by the Institute of Mathematics and Mathematical
Modelling, organized by Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

While time passes, and other mathematicians eventually confirm or reject
Otelbayev's proof, I want to take a closer look at the problem of the
[Navier–Stokes Equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations).
To be able to do that, I need to cover a lot of ground in the not-so trivial
land of mathematics. The starting point has been chosen:
["Stochastic differential equation"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation).
Working through the
[An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](http://www.math.uh.edu/~torok/math_6397_SDE/Evans_SDE.course_v1.2_2011.08.pdf) by [Lawrence C. Evans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_C._Evans).
