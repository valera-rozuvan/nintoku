I have often had the need to quickly write some tool/app for demonstration
purposes. It generally consists of an index.html file, some JavaScript files,
and a few CSS files. The bare bones skeleton (template) I wrote from scratch
each and every time, and then added to it the actual content. I always thought
that it would be a good idea to save such a skeleton for future reuse. Finally,
I got around to
[doing just so](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/simple-html5-template).
