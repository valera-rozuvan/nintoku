A group **G** is a collection of objects with an operation [satisfying the
following rules (axioms)](http://nrich.maths.org/1422).

Today I realized that the **operation** is actually what defines a group, NOT
the collection of objects. A collection of object is not a group (of objects)
as I previously thought (probably because I was making a connection between the
English meaning of the word group and the mathematical term group). Also, a
group can lose it's status if it's operation changes but the collection of
objects remains the same (if some of the axioms stop being true for the new
operation).
