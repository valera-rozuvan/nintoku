I have just discovered about the coolest thing ever since I last discovered
the [Gnome desktop](http://www.gnome.org/). It is [Gjs: Javascript Bindings for
GNOME](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Gjs?action=show&redirect=Gjs).

What is Gjs? Quoting from the home page

> Gjs is a JavaScript binding for GNOME. It's mainly based on Spidermonkey
JavaScript engine and the GObject introspection framework.

I have already set up a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/gjs-test-examples) to
mess around with it.
